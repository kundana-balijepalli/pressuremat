# pressuremat
This is a component of my capstone project

### Project Description

Designed a biofeedback system for dance training that takes in an input of foot plantar pressure and outputs a real-time pressure map. 
The image shows the pressure distribution of the subject's feet.

### Approach
The program reads pressure readings from an arduino microcontroller and stores the data into a numerical array. 
The numerical array is then displayed on a color scale as an image.  

### Built with
- numpy
-	scipy
-	matplotlib
